Detecting whether chicken is suffring with coccidiosis disease or not by checking chicken fecal

Coccidiosis is a parasitic disease of the intestinal tract of animals caused by coccidian protozoa. The disease spreads from one animal to another by contact with infected feces or ingestion of infected tissue. Diarrhea, which may become bloody in severe cases, is the primary symptom. Most animals infected with coccidia are asymptomatic, but young or immunocompromised animals may suffer severe symptoms and death. 

Prevention is key and is achieved with use of anticoccidials or vaccination. Diagnosis is by fecal flotation to detect oocysts, often in combination with characteristic necropsy findings.
